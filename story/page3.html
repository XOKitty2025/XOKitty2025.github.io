        <h2>Belle's Arrival</h2>
        <p>Belle, courageous and kind, arrived at the castle. 
        Initially frightened by the Beast's appearance, she soon 
        learned that he was not as cruel as he seemed. The two began to 
        communicate, and Belle discovered that the Beast was actually a 
        prince under a curse. The curse could only be broken by true love, 
        but time was running out. If no one loved the Beast before the last 
        petal of the enchanted rose fell, the curse would be permanent.</p>
