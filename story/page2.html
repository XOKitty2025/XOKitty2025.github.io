        <h2>The Beginning</h2>
        <p>Once upon a time, a <span class="highlight">merchant</span> 
        was traveling when he came across a mysterious castle. 
        As he ventured inside, he was greeted by a 
        <span class="highlight">Beast</span> who demanded that he stay for 
        dinner. The merchant, frightened, explained that he had a daughter, 
        <span class="highlight">Belle</span>, who would be devastated if he 
        never returned.</p>
        <p>The Beast agreed to let him go, but only if Belle would come in his
        place. The merchant reluctantly agreed to the Beast's terms.</p>
