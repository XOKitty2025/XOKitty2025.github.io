        <h2>The Transformation & Conclusion</h2>
        <p>As time passed, Belle and the Beast grew closer, 
        and she began to see beyond his appearance. She learned to 
        love him for who he truly was. In a moment of crisis, Belle 
        realized that she loved the Beast, and just as the last petal of the 
        enchanted rose was about to fall, the curse was broken. 
        The Beast transformed back into his true form a handsome prince. 
        Belle and the prince lived happily ever after.</p>
